# Straggler-Mitigation-MatMul
This repository contains our code and presentation for comparing the effectiveness of the <i>entangled polynomial code</i> with that of a naive <i>repetition code</i> for straggler mitigation in distributed matrix multiplication, done as part of the course project for EE 605 (Error Correcting Codes), Autumn 2022, IIT Bombay.

Authors: Ankit Kumar Misra and Dhruva Dhingra

Organization:
1. `src/` contains:

    1. `polynomial_code.py`: Function `polynomial_matmul` takes matrices $A$ and $B$ (along with other parameters), uses entangled polynomial coding to perform distributed matrix multiplication `avg_over` number of times, and returns the average error, average execution time, and average preprocessing time.
    2. `redundant_code.py`: Function `redundant_matmul` takes matrices $A$ and $B$ (along with other parameters), uses repetitive coding to perform distributed matrix multiplication `avg_over` number of times, and returns the average error and average execution time.
    3. `plot.py`:
    
        1. Generates a plot of error versus recovery threshold for two entangled polynomial codes, one having equally spaced nodes and the other having Chebyshev nodes.
        2. Generates a plot of execution times and preprocessing times versus matrix size, using entangled polynomial coding and repetitive coding.

2. `plots/` contains sample plots generated by our code.
3. `presentation/` contains our project presentation's LaTeX source and PDF, generated using Beamer.
